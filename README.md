# rgbds-obj

A Rust crate for working with RGBDS object files.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/rgbds-obj) ~ [Check it out on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rgbds-obj)

This crate is only meant to aid in parsing already serialized files, not build them.

Note that compatibility is important: the current goal is to support as many object file format
revisions as possible.

## Example usage

[`rgbobj`](https://crates.io/crates/rgbobj) is a program using this crate to parse such files.
